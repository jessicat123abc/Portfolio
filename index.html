    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2> Jessica Thompson</h2>

    <p> I'm Not yet sure how I am going to try to make my website accessible to all users. I found other people changing the font of the text, changing the text alignment, and adding pictures, They did this by adding new parts to the code in styles. So far, I am most proud of learning a bit of how html work, and how to add interesting things to my website.

    <p class= "paragraph2">
      trying something
    </p>

    <p id="thing">
      trying stuff
    </p>

    <p> I'm still trying to make my website more accessible by making the text more readable against the background.
        Some things I saw on other people's websites that I thought were cool were some input bars and dropdown menus. I am not entirely sure how they managed to do these things though.
        So far I am most proud of learning how to use javascript a little more and some of the things you can do with it, like with the mad libs stories, like using buttons and input bars.

    <button type="button" onclick="randomFunction()">Trying out buttons</button>

    <script>
    function randomFunction() {
      document.getElementById("thing").innerHTML = "It Worked!";
    }
    </script>

    <script>
    window.alert('welcome to my website')
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
